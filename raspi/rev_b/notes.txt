Patches:

1) Cut trace between Pin 3-U4 and C10.
2) Add wire between N3-1 and C10.

Notes:

1) R8 points to C10; the real R8 is between R8 and C10.
2) The footprint for D2 is confusing.  The diode got
   installed backwards.
3) U5 Pin 8 should be connected to N3 3V3 (pin3 1,17).
4) The power traces for U4 are a little close to
   to vias, one another, etc.
5) Hook up the following voltages and pins:
   N3-01 3.3V
   N3-17 3.3V

   N3-02 5V0
   N3-04 5V0

   N3-06 GND
   N3-14 GND
   N3-20 GND
   N3-09 GND
   N3-25 GND
6) It would be nice to see the console output on boot-up.
